üìÅ Project Overview
This project involves creating a structured relational database named supermarket_analysis to analyze retail sales data from a fictional Superstore. The dataset captures customer orders, product details, shipping logistics, and financial metrics. The goal is to extract actionable insights using SQL queries.
